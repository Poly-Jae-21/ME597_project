\frametitle{Emergency Microgrid Resilience}

\bit % the command "bit" is short for "\begin{itemize}", which starts a list
\item Microgid: interconnected loads and distributed energy resourdces with connect or disconnect from the grid, can provide resilience to emergency situations. 
\item Increasing the importance of emergence microgrid resilience to comabt increasing emergency situations (e.g., power outrages, natural disasters, individual problems).

\frametitle{Problem statement}
Distriubtion System Resilience Enhancement
\bit 
\item has focused on maximizing the total prioritized load to be picked up, using mathematical programming and iterative algorithms.
\item has also considered the uncertainty capture in the distribution system operating framework. 
\item However, their model cannot be fully utilized into the comprehensive situations, with mitigating the load unbalance and capturing the uncertainty situation in the microgrid operation model, simultaneously. 
\eit 

\pause
\bigskip
$\rightarrow$ Need to applicable algorithm for coping with the comprehensive situation, while optimizing/mitigating the load disturbance in energy trading with microgrid system.

\frametitle{Methodology: Data generation}
\bit
\item Team cannot find the relevant datasets, including the information of DERs and loads.
\item Team utilized class materials (linear dynamical systems) to generate the data (e.g., PV power output, charging/discharging) 
\item Emergency situation is created by referencing the national renewable energy laboratory (NREL) research that cumulative probability of power outrage is less than 1\%.

\frametitle{Methodology: DRL algorithm}
\bit
\item This project developed existing research, P2P energy trading, through integrating with the detection/mitigation of the emergency risks in the microgrid. 
\item The multi agents (e.g., consumer, prosumer, producer) interact with an environment (e.g., energy load, PV power output and charging/discharging) to minimize the energy cost (CO$_2$ cost), with mitigating the risk of emergency risks. 
\item Each agent takes three actions (e.g., battery state, detection of PV emergency, detection of load emergency) in six states.
\item The reward function get the highest expectations when the model find the minimization point of energy costs.

\frametitle{Discussion \& Conclusion}
\bit
\item This project developed the microgrid energy trading model with mitigating emergency disturbance using deep reinforcement learning
\item Proposed method tried to detect the emergency events while estimating the energy traiding with minizing the $co_2$ emission. 
\item However, proposed method does learn the energy trading rule well, but fails to detect the emergency situation accurately: 1) low quality of datasets, 2) deficiency of extracting features in the environment. 
\item In the future, I will update the learning model with building it on meta-learning and graph neural network.
